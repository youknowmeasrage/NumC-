NUMC++ LIBRARY - AUTHORSHIP AND ERRORS NOTICE

CREDITS AND AUTHORSHIP:
------------------------
This library (Numc++) is a comprehensive C++ implementation of NumPy-like
functionality for numerical computing.

IMPORTANT:
- Only approximately 20 core functions were manually written by the original
  developer.
- The remaining functions (approximately 200+) were generated using AI
  assistance (prompted through Cursor) and may contain errors or limitations.

ERROR REPORTING:
----------------
If you encounter any errors, bugs, or unexpected behavior, please report them to:
    Email: sabhay@zohomail.in

Include in your report:
- Description of the error
- Minimal code example that reproduces the issue
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Operating system and compiler version

LIMITATIONS:
------------
- Some functions may have incomplete or simplified implementations
- Advanced features like FFT, SVD, and eigendecomposition have basic implementations
- Bitwise operations are approximated using integer conversions
- Complex number operations are not fully supported
- Memory management is basic and may need optimization for large arrays

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK:
---------------------
This library is provided as-is for educational and development purposes.
No warranty is provided. Use at your own risk.

CONTRIBUTIONS:
--------------
Contributions and improvements are welcome. Please report bugs or submit
